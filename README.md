## About the Project:

This repository contains the source code for a chatbot designed for Pandeyji Eatery. The chatbot is built using FastAPI, integrates with Dialogflow, and utilizes a local MySQL database for order tracking.

### Project Components:

- **Coding:**
  - `main.py`: Main script handling chatbot requests using FastAPI.
  - `db_helper.py`: Python script for database-related operations.
  - `generic_helper.py`: Python script containing generic helper functions.

- **DB:**
  - `pandeyji_eatery.sql`: MySQL database script containing table structures.

- **Website:**
  - `index.html`: Dummy website HTML code.
  - `style.css`: CSS styling for the dummy website.

### How to Explore:

1. **Review Code:**
   - Explore the `coding` folder for the main scripts.
   - Understand how the chatbot processes orders and interacts with the database.

2. **Database Structure:**
   - Check the `db` folder for the MySQL database script (`pandeyji_eatery.sql`) to understand the data structure.

3. **Website Dummy Content:**
   - Examine the `website` folder for the dummy website HTML and CSS (`home.html` and `styles.css`) used for chatbot interaction.
